# Deep Diagnosis
This is a research oriented project where we have tried to use machine learning models for classification tasks using images as an input. We've used CNN model for the task of image analysis and classification. The architecture of our model is a standard architecture used by many in the industry. The architecture is called Inception model.

The model architecture can be found here => <a href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf">Inception Model</a>
Information regarding the datasets can be found in the references section.

# How to get it working?

## The Core
The core part of the project is simply a program that loads in the trained model and passes an image through it for classification.<br>





# Usage
Import predict.py to your project
``` python
              import predict.py as pred
              # method for classifying skin lesions
              # returns a string stating whether the lesion is melignant(Cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous) with a percent confidence
              pred.classifySkinLesion(image);
              
              # method for classifying diabetic retinopathy
              # returns a string stating whether the image has a chance of diabetic ratinopathy (Normal, Moderate, Severe) with a percent confidence.
              pred.classifyDiabeticRetinopathy(image);
              
              # Your Program.
```

# Integration
* DeepDiagnosis can be integrated with any device or technology.

# Example
* Example of DeepDiagnosis integrated on an Android Device.
